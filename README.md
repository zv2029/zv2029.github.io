# The Memory Garden

## Project Description

The Memory Garden is a hidden gem located just outside our Comms Lab classroom, often overlooked by those passing by. This cozy, inviting space serves as a sanctuary where individuals can sit, ground themselves, and connect with nature. With its lush greenery and tranquil atmosphere, it provides a perfect backdrop for reflection and relaxation. I genuinely believe this serene environment is seriously underrated and deserves more recognition.

Designed to stimulate the senses, The Memory Garden features a variety of plants and flowers that evoke memories and emotions. It is not just a place to unwind; it is a space that encourages visitors to engage with their personal histories and the natural world around them. The garden acts as a portal into our pasts, inviting us to appreciate the beauty of our surroundings while fostering a deeper connection to our memories. As someone who has spent considerable time in this enchanting space, I can attest to its calming influence. Whether you're seeking solitude or a place to gather with friends, The Memory Garden offers a unique experience that nurtures both the mind and spirit. It is a reminder of the importance of nature in our lives and how it can help us cultivate our memories in meaningful ways.

In terms of the video, our goal is to craft an immersive experience that resonates like white noise, gently guiding viewers into a state of tranquility as they engage with the video. The moment you press play, you're invited to embark on a journey inward, stepping back from the chaos of daily life to reconnect with your inner self. In today's fast-paced world, it's all too easy to lose touch with our core essence amidst the constant demands and distractions. This video serves as a meditative anchor, offering a much-needed respite and an opportunity for introspection. As the visuals unfold, they create a serene backdrop for self-reflection, allowing viewers to check in with their thoughts, emotions, and overall well-being.

Both my partner and I were drawn to the dark academia aesthetic for this project. This style, with its moody atmosphere and intellectual undertones, provides the perfect visual language to encourage deep thought and contemplation. The rich, shadowy palette and classic imagery associated with dark academia create an environment conducive to slowing down and focusing inward.

## Process

Building upon this concept, I decided that the website design must also mirror the dark academia aesthetic of the video. This includes a rich, muted color palette dominated by deep greens, warm browns, and soft golds. I carefully selected fonts that evoke a sense of timeless elegance, opting for serifs that complement the overall theme and enhance readability. After some careful digging on Google Fonts, I found the ideal font—Libre Baskerville—which offers various styles.

The index page greets visitors with a minimalist layout centered around a dropping title animation. This design choice ensures that the meditative experience is front and center, inviting immediate engagement.

Navigation through the site is intentionally intuitive and unobtrusive. We've implemented a clean, sticky navigation bar that allows users to access additional content without disrupting the serene environment we've cultivated. This additional content includes:

1. **Memory Garden Page**: Delves deeper into our philosophy and the science behind mindfulness.
2. **About Section**: Showcases still images paired with thought-provoking quotes to inspire reflection.
3. **Home Page**: Offers easy access back to the landing page.

To enhance user experience, we've incorporated subtle interactivity throughout the site. Hover effects on buttons and links are designed to be smooth and non-disruptive, maintaining an overall sense of calm.

This website is completely different from my original wireframe. While my landing page remained mostly unchanged—keeping a large title and slogan along with an interactive nav bar at the top—I made significant adjustments throughout other sections based on user feedback.

## Reflection

In conclusion, I am genuinely proud of the progress I've made throughout this project, particularly in enhancing both interactivity and aesthetic appeal. My primary goal was to create an immersive experience that resonates with users, allowing them to reflect and connect with their memories in a meaningful way.

The incorporation of interactive elements such as the slideshow and "About Me" section has significantly enriched user engagement. The design choices inspired by dark academia have not only provided a visually captivating interface but also fostered an atmosphere conducive to introspection.

Reflecting on this journey has taught me the importance of balancing functionality with aesthetics. While my initial vision has evolved, it has ultimately led to a more cohesive and engaging user experience. The feedback received has been invaluable in refining my approach and ensuring that the final product aligns with my original goals.

Overall, this project has deepened my understanding of web design and user interaction while reinforcing my passion for creating spaces that promote mindfulness and self-reflection. I look forward to continuing this journey and exploring new ways to enhance user experiences in future iterations.
