        <h3>5. Finding Peace and Healing</h3>
        <p>The final and perhaps most poignant moment in Katniss's journey is her ultimate victory - not over external enemies, but over the trauma and pain that have defined her life. In the epilogue, we see Katniss years later, having built a life with Peeta and starting a family. This quiet moment of peace is a powerful contrast to the violence and turmoil of her earlier life. It represents Katniss's resilience and her ability to heal, even after enduring unimaginable horrors. Her decision to have children, despite her earlier fears, shows her growing trust in the new world she helped create. This ending is not just a personal victory for Katniss, but a testament to the human spirit's capacity for recovery and hope. It's a reminder that even after war and loss, there is the possibility for joy and renewal. Katniss's journey from a girl fighting for survival to a woman who has found peace serves as an inspiring conclusion to her epic story.</p>
